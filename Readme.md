## 🧠 About This Project

**Killing Time Games** is a lightweight browser-based app designed to help users pass the time—without losing focus or falling down a digital rabbit hole. Whether you're waiting for your name to be called at a job interview or sitting in a hospital lobby, this is your guilt-free way to stay occupied.

No zombies, no explosions—just quick, silly fun with a personal touch. The app features a pure black theme with enhanced visibility, providing a sleek and easy-on-the-eyes experience.

It includes three familiar games—**Rock Paper Scissors**, **Coin Flip**, and **Odds & Evens**—each with unique game modes. You can play the classic versions, enjoy themed “Fun” matchups (like *The Rock vs. Toilet Paper*), or invent your own characters and rules.

This isn’t about leveling up or beating a final boss—it’s a pocket-sized distraction built for real-world lulls, not digital war zones.
