## 🧠 About This Project

**Killing Time Games** is a lightweight browser-based app designed for moments when you're stuck waiting—but still want to stay mentally present.

If you're about to walk into a job interview, waiting at the hospital for a loved one, or just in one of life’s many pauses, this app gives you a simple way to pass the time **without taking your head out of the game of life**.

No zombies, no explosions—just quick, silly fun with a personal touch. The app features a pure black theme with enhanced visibility, providing a sleek and easy-on-the-eyes experience.

It includes three familiar games—**Rock Paper Scissors**, **Coin Flip**, and **Odds & Evens**—each with unique game modes. You can play the classic versions, enjoy themed “Fun” matchups (like *The Rock vs. Toilet Paper*), or invent your own characters and rules.

This isn’t about leveling up or beating a final boss—it’s a pocket-sized distraction built for real-world lulls, not digital war zones.

> **It’s not about wasting time. It’s about killing time—calmly, cleanly, and on your terms.**
