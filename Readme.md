Mindless Games to Kill Time (Without Losing Your Mind)
🧠 About This Project
Killing Time Games is a lightweight browser-based app designed to help users pass the time—without losing focus or falling down a digital rabbit hole. Whether you're waiting for your name to be called at a job interview or sitting in a hospital lobby, this is your guilt-free way to stay occupied. No zombies, no explosions—just quick, silly fun with a personal touch. The app features a pure black theme with enhanced visibility, providing a sleek and easy-on-the-eyes experience.

The app includes three familiar games—Rock Paper Scissors, Coin Flip, and Odds & Evens—each with unique game modes. You can play the classic versions, enjoy themed “Fun” matchups (like The Rock vs. Toilet Paper), or invent your own characters and rules.

This isn’t about leveling up or beating a final boss—it’s a pocket-sized distraction built for real-world lulls, not digital war zones.
